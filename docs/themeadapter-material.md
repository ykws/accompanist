!!! warning
    **This library is deprecated, and the API is no longer maintained.** The original documentation is below.

## Migration
Recommendation: Use the [Material Theme Builder](https://m3.material.io/theme-builder) tool, or an alternative design tool, to generate a matching XML and Compose theme implementation for your app. See [Migrating XML themes to Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/designsystems/views-to-compose) to learn more.

You can checkout [Material Design 3 in Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/designsystems/material3#material-theming) to learn more about creating and adding theme to your app using Material Theme Builder.

## Original Documenation

A library that enables the reuse of [MDC-Android][mdc] Material 2 XML themes, for theming in [Jetpack Compose][compose].

![Material Theme Adapter header](themeadapter/material-header.png)

The basis of Material Design 2 theming in [Jetpack Compose][compose] is the [`MaterialTheme`][materialtheme] composable, where you provide [`Colors`][colors], [`Typography`][typography] and [`Shapes`][shapes] instances containing your styling parameters:

``` kotlin
MaterialTheme(
    colors = colors,
    typography = type,
    shapes = shapes
) {
    // M2 Surface, Scaffold, etc.
}
```

[Material Components for Android][mdc] themes allow for similar theming for views via XML theme attributes, like so:

``` xml
<style name="Theme.MyApp" parent="Theme.MaterialComponents.DayNight">
    <!-- Material 2 color attributes -->
    <item name="colorPrimary">@color/purple_500</item>
    <item name="colorSecondary">@color/green_200</item>

    <!-- Material 2 type attributes-->
    <item name="textAppearanceBody1">@style/TextAppearance.MyApp.Body1</item>
    <item name="textAppearanceBody2">@style/TextAppearance.MyApp.Body2</item>

    <!-- Material 2 shape attributes-->
    <item name="shapeAppearanceSmallComponent">@style/ShapeAppearance.MyApp.SmallComponent</item>
</style>
```

This library attempts to bridge the gap between [Material Components for Android][mdc] M2 XML themes, and themes in [Jetpack Compose][compose], allowing your composable [`MaterialTheme`][materialtheme] to be based on the `Activity`'s XML theme:


``` kotlin
MdcTheme {
    // MaterialTheme.colors, MaterialTheme.typography, MaterialTheme.shapes
    // will now contain copies of the Context's theme
}
```

This is especially handy when you're migrating an existing app, a `Fragment` (or other UI container) at a time.

!!! caution
    If you are using an AppCompat (i.e. non-MDC) theme in your app, you should use
    [AppCompat Theme Adapter](https://github.com/google/accompanist/tree/main/themeadapter-appcompat)
    instead, as it attempts to bridge the gap between [AppCompat][appcompat] XML themes, and M2 themes in [Jetpack Compose][compose].

### Customizing the M2 theme

The [`MdcTheme()`][mdctheme] function will automatically read the host `Context`'s MDC theme and pass them to [`MaterialTheme`][materialtheme] on your behalf, but if you want to customize the generated values, you can do so via the [`createMdcTheme()`][createmdctheme] function:

``` kotlin
val context = LocalContext.current
val layoutDirection = LocalLayoutDirection.current
var (colors, typography, shapes) = createMdcTheme(
    context = context,
    layoutDirection = layoutDirection
)

// Modify colors, typography or shapes as required.
// Then pass them through to MaterialTheme...

MaterialTheme(
    colors = colors ?: MaterialTheme.colors,
    typography = typography ?: MaterialTheme.typography,
    shapes = shapes ?: MaterialTheme.shapes
) {
    // Rest of M2 layout
}
```

### Limitations

There are some known limitations with the implementation at the moment:

* This relies on your `Activity`/`Context` theme extending one of the `Theme.MaterialComponents` themes.
* Text colors are not read from the text appearances by default. You can enable it via the `setTextColors` function parameter.
* Variable fonts are not supported in Compose yet, meaning that the value of `android:fontVariationSettings` are currently ignored.
* MDC `ShapeAppearances` allow setting of different corner families (cut, rounded) on each corner, whereas Compose's [Shapes][shapes] allows only a single corner family for the entire shape. Therefore only the `app:cornerFamily` attribute is read, others (`app:cornerFamilyTopLeft`, etc) are ignored.
* You can modify the resulting `MaterialTheme` in Compose as required, but this _only_ works in Compose. Any changes you make will not be reflected in the `Activity` theme.
