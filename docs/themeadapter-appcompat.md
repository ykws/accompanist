!!! warning
    **This library is deprecated, and the API is no longer maintained.** The original documentation is below.

## Migration
Recommendation: Use the [Material Theme Builder](https://m3.material.io/theme-builder) tool, or an alternative design tool, to generate a matching XML and Compose theme implementation for your app. See [Migrating XML themes to Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/designsystems/views-to-compose) to learn more.

You can checkout [Material Design 3 in Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/designsystems/material3#material-theming) to learn more about creating and adding theme to your app using Material Theme Builder.

## Original Documenation

A library that enables the reuse of [AppCompat][appcompat] XML themes, for theming in [Jetpack Compose][compose].

The basis of theming in [Jetpack Compose][compose] is the [`MaterialTheme`][materialtheme] composable, where you provide [`Colors`][colors], [`Shapes`][shapes] and [`Typography`][typography] instances containing your styling parameters:

``` kotlin
MaterialTheme(
    typography = type,
    colors = colors,
    shapes = shapes
) {
    // Surface, Scaffold, etc
}
```

[AppCompat][appcompat] XML themes allow for similar but coarser theming via XML theme attributes, like so:

``` xml
<style name="Theme.MyApp" parent="Theme.AppCompat.DayNight">
    <item name="colorPrimary">@color/purple_500</item>
    <item name="colorAccent">@color/green_200</item>
</style>
```

This library attempts to bridge the gap between [AppCompat][appcompat] XML themes, and themes in [Jetpack Compose][compose], allowing your composable [`MaterialTheme`][materialtheme] to be based on the `Activity`'s XML theme:

``` kotlin
AppCompatTheme {
    // MaterialTheme.colors, MaterialTheme.shapes, MaterialTheme.typography
    // will now contain copies of the context's theme
}
```

This is especially handy when you're migrating an existing app, a fragment (or other UI container) at a time.

!!! caution
    If you are using [Material Design Components][mdc] in your app, you should use the
    [Material Theme Adapter](https://github.com/google/accompanist/tree/main/themeadapter-material) or
    [Material 3 Theme Adapter](https://github.com/google/accompanist/tree/main/themeadapter-material3)
    instead, as they allow much finer-grained reading of your theme.


### Customizing the theme

The [`AppCompatTheme()`][appcompattheme] function will automatically read the host context's AppCompat theme and pass them to [`MaterialTheme`][materialtheme] on your behalf, but if you want to customize the generated values, you can do so via the [`createAppCompatTheme()`][createappcompattheme] function:

``` kotlin
val context = LocalContext.current
var (colors, type) = context.createAppCompatTheme()

// Modify colors or type as required. Then pass them
// through to MaterialTheme...

MaterialTheme(
    colors = colors,
    typography = type
) {
    // rest of layout
}
```

</details>

## Generated theme

Synthesizing a material theme from a `Theme.AppCompat` theme is not perfect, since `Theme.AppCompat`
does not expose the same level of customization as is available in material theming.
Going through the pillars of material theming:

### Colors

AppCompat has a limited set of top-level color attributes, which means that [`AppCompatTheme()`][appcompattheme]
has to generate/select alternative colors in certain situations. The mapping is currently:

| MaterialTheme color | AppCompat attribute                                            |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| primary             | `colorPrimary`                                          |
| primaryVariant      | `colorPrimaryDark`                                      |
| onPrimary           | Calculated black/white                                |
| secondary           | `colorAccent`                                           |
| secondaryVariant    | `colorAccent`                                           |
| onSecondary         | Calculated black/white                                |
| surface             | Default                                               |
| onSurface           | `android:textColorPrimary`, else calculated black/white |
| background          | `android:colorBackground`                               |
| onBackground        | `android:textColorPrimary`, else calculated black/white |
| error               | `colorError`                                            |
| onError             | Calculated black/white                                |

Where the table says "calculated black/white", this means either black/white, depending on
which provides the greatest contrast against the corresponding background color.

### Typography

AppCompat does not provide any semantic text appearances (such as headline6, body1, etc), and
instead relies on text appearances for specific widgets or use cases. As such, the only thing
we read from an AppCompat theme is the default `app:fontFamily` or `android:fontFamily`.
For example:

``` xml
<style name="Theme.MyApp" parent="Theme.AppCompat">
    <item name="fontFamily">@font/my_font</item>
</style>
```

Compose does not currently support downloadable fonts, so any font referenced from the theme
should from your resources. See [here](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/font-resource)
for more information.

### Shape

AppCompat has no concept of shape theming, therefore we use the default value from
[`MaterialTheme.shapes`][shapes]. If you wish to provide custom values, use the `shapes` parameter on `AppCompatTheme`.

## Limitations

There are some known limitations with the implementation at the moment:

* This relies on your `Activity`/`Context` theme extending one of the `Theme.AppCompat` themes.
* Variable fonts are not supported in Compose yet, meaning that the value of `android:fontVariationSettings` are currently ignored.
* You can modify the resulting `MaterialTheme` in Compose as required, but this _only_ works in Compose. Any changes you make will not be reflected in the Activity theme.
